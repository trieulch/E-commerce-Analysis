Questions:
- **Q1**: Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions 
and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?

- **Q2**: Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and 
brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.  
- **Q3**: While we’re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device 
type? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.  
- **Q4**: I’m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from 
Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?  
- **Q5**: I’d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. 
Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?  
- **Q6**: For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us. Period: (Jun 19 – Jul 28)
- **Q7**: For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel from each 
of the two pages to orders. Period: (Jun 19 – Jul 28)  
- **Q8**: I’d love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test 
(Sep 10 – Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions 
for the past month to understand monthly impact  
- **Q9**: First, I’d like to show our volume growth. Can you pull overall session and order volume, trended by quarter 
for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it.  
- **Q10**: Next, let’s showcase all of our efficiency improvements. I would love to show quarterly figures since we 
launched, for session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, and revenue per session.  
- **Q11**: I’d like to show how we’ve grown specific channels. Could you pull a quarterly view of orders from Gsearch 
nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search, and direct type-in?  
- **Q12**: Next, let’s show the overall session-to-order conversion rate trends for those same channels, by quarter. 
Please also make a note of any periods where we made major improvements or optimizations.  
- **Q13**: We’ve come a long way since the days of selling a single product. Let’s pull monthly trending for revenue 
and margin by product, along with total sales and revenue. Note anything you notice about seasonality.  
- **Q14**: Let’s dive deeper into the impact of introducing new products. Please pull monthly sessions to the /products 
page, and show how the % of those sessions clicking through another page has changed over time, along with 
a view of how conversion from /products to placing an order has improved  
- **Q15**: We made our 4th product available as a primary product on December 05, 2014 (it was previously only a cross-sell 
item). Could you please pull sales data since then, and show how well each product cross-sells from one another?    

I will publish my dashboard power BI later.
