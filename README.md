The content for e-commerce analysis
It's only included the code in sql(Mysql)
Data from mavenAnalytics but paid courses. There is no published data here. But the e-commerce data is quite common so you can take from multiple sources. :D

   **Channel Portfolio and Management & Business Patterns and Seasonality**
   **Product Analysis**
   **User Analysis**

This is good base for rookies.
